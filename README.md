# How To Create a Character for Call of Cthulhu RPG
These are the "quick" rules to making a character, called an `Investigator`, in the role-playing game `Call of Cthulhu`.
## How to use this repository
In this repository you will find `character sheets` in the form of PDF files. The `CoC 7e - 1920s - Character Sheet.pdf` file is the default file for a character in the 1920s. However, additionaly, there are 2 PDF files that can auto-calculate the skill values, one for a character in the 1920s and one for the Modern era. It is recommended to read this guide while you have the `character sheet` open.

You can download the files by pressing on the green "**<> Code**" button and choosing "**Download ZIP**".
## Characteristics
### What are Characteristics?
Your character's main `Characteristics` are the following:
* `STR` - **Strength**: How strong you are
* `CON` - **Constituition**: How physically resilient you are
* `SIZ` - **Size**: How big you are
* `DEX` - **Dexterity**: How agile you are
* `APP` - **Appearance**: How handsome you are
* `EDU` - **Education**: How knowledgable you are
* `INT` - **Intelligence**: How intelligent you are
* `POW` - **Power**: How much force of will do you have (connected to magic)
* `Move Rate`: How quick you are


### How to fill my `Characteristics`?
You have 8 base `Characteristics` + `Move Rate` (which is derived from `DEX`). You get 8 values, which you can assign any way you like into the 8 base `Characteristics` (all `Characteristics` except `Move Rate`).

The values are: <br/> 
40, 50, 50, 50, 60, 60, 70, 80

So, for example, you can assign `STR`=40, `CON`=50, `SIZ`=50, `DEX`=80, etc...

#### Move Rate
To calculate your `Move Rate`:
* If `DEX` < `SIZE` & `STR` < `SIZE`: `Move Rate` = 7
* If `DEX` > `SIZE` & `STR` > `SIZE`: `Move Rate` = 9
* Else: `Move Rate` = 8

## Hit Points, Sanity, Luck & Magic Points
In addition to your main `Characteristics`, you have the following stats:
* `Hit Points`: How much health before you collapse, faint or die
* `Sanity`: How mentally stable you are
* `Luck`: How lucky you are
* `Magic Points`: Points that can be spent using magic

These stats are differnet in that these may frequently change during play. Therefore, you need to either write down or circle their `current value` and `max value`. When just creating your character, the `current value` = `max value`. 

### Hit Points
`Hit Points` = (`SIZ` + `CON`) / 10

### Sanity
`Sanity` = `POW`

### Luck
`Luck` = **3D6** * 5

Roll **3D6** (roll 3 normal 6-sided dice, and add up the result). **Multiply the result by 5**. That's your `Luck`.

### Magic Points
`Magic Points` = `POW` / 5

## Skills
This section includes your character's `skills`. When first creating a character, your skills come from either your `occupation` (your job) or your `Personal Interests`. <br/>
Notice that in your `character sheet`, there are numbers listed next to the `skills`. These are `default skills`. You always get these points regardless of `occupation` or `personal interests`.

### Occupation
Each occupation gives you a list of 8 `skills` + `Credit Rating`. `Credit Ratings` is a general way of defining how rich you are and how upper class you look.

You can either choose an `occupation` from the sample list, or make up your own!

For your `occupation` skills, including `Credit Rating`, you get the following points: <br/>
70, 60, 60, 50, 50, 50, 40, 40, 40

Try to fit your `Credit Rating` with what seems to be appropriate for your `occupation` of choice. For example, Private Investigators are not particularily rich or classy.

### Personal Interests
These skills are what your character is interested outside his `occupation`. You may choose any skill you want, with the exception of `Credit Rating` (which was already filled in the `occupation` section), and the `Cthulhu Mythos` skills, which can only be gained through experience.

The skill points for this section are: <br/>
+20, +20, +20, +20, +20

Notice the '+' sign. These are to be added **on top** of the default skill value. So, for example, `First Aid` is set to 30 by default. You may add on top of this with +20 to bring the skill level to 50.


### Language
For the `language` skill, you should list your 'native language' (English, most of the times) and set its value be `EDU` <br/>
`language` (English) = `EDU`

If, either due to your `occupation` or for a `Personal Interests`, you know another `language`, list it's name and assign it skill points.


## Weapons
List here any `weapons` in your possesion. The `weapon` stats should be consulted with the `Keeper` (the Game Master).

## Combat
`Damage Bonus`, or `DB` in short, is added to your physical melee attacks. `Build` is a combination of your strength and size - relevant when trying to pull off fighting manuevers against enemies, like tripping them or holding them down. `Dodge` is your ability to evade attacks.
* `Dodge` = `DEX` / 2

To calculate `Damage Bonus` and `Build`, use the following table:
| `STR` + `SIZ` | `Damage Bonus` | `Build`|
|----------|-------------|------|
| 2 to 64 | -2 | -2 |
| 65 to 84 | -1 | -1 | 
| 85 to 124 | 0 | 0 |
| 125 to 164 | +1D4 |  1 |
| 165 to 204 | +1D6 | 2 | 

<!-- | 205 to 284 | +2D6 | 3 | -->
<!-- | 285 to 364 | +3D6 | 4 |  -->
<!-- | 365 to 444 | +4D6 | 5 |  -->
<!-- | 445 to 524 | +5D6 | 6 |  -->
